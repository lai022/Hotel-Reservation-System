This is a front end hotel reservation and payment system.

Description:

First, we chose a hotel reservation system as our system. And then, On the first page, the user needs to input their name, IC number, phone number and email. After that, the system will take the user to the homepage. On the home page there are 4 options to select, which are reservation, edit reservation, payment and exit. 

On the reservation page, the user can make many reservations and each reservation belongs to one user. After that, the system will display what room we got and the user can select one room and then the user needs to input the number of people, the check-in date, and how long the user wants to stay. And then the system will display the details of the reservation that the user reserved. And then the system will go back to the homepage. 

If the user wishes to make some changes to the reservation, then the user can go to the edit reservation function. In this function, the user can edit the reservation that the user made just now.

On the payment page, it will display all the reservations that the user made and then the user can select which reservation that he/she wants to pay,  after that the system also will ask the user which payment method they prefer to use. The option has cash or card (Debit Card or Credit Card). If the user selects the card method, it will prompt the user to enter their card number, CVV number and card expiration date. After the payment is done, it will display the receipt to the user and then the system will go back to the homepage also.

Lastly, the exit function, this function just lets the user choose to exit the system.
